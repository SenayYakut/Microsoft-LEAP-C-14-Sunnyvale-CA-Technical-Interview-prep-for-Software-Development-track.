# Questions from Glassdoor

1. Write a program to determine if two football team can  successfully take a picture with each person face showing. i.e. no taller player standing in front of a shorter one. You must keep each team on a separate line, but you can arrange the players in a team any way you want to.(Microsoft LEAP Interview Redmond, WA)
__HINT__: The answer involves sorting and comparing. Sort the array, then check to make sure all the players on the team in front are shorter than all players in the team behind.

2. The second question was a system design question. Basically, how would you design a payroll system, then how to generate individual keys for a system, and he kept tagging more questions to the original system design question.
__Hint__:The answer included various things, reading from the database, issuing payout in parallel, authentication and authorization and every other thing I could think of. The key thing here was observing the interviewer and following his lead. i.e if he looks like he likes it then it's a good design if he doesn't just scrap it and think of something else.

3. Problem solving : How do you identify if any given point lies within a rectangle
4. write a function to determine if a word is a palindromeces
5. Given an array of integers, return the first two integers that add up to 10.
6. Construct a method using data structures, 
7. determine if a string was an anagram) and discuss the Big O notation of various approaches.
8. if they gave you a chance what Microsoft product you would be improving ang how?
9. Design an ATM machine

* Leet code, cracking the code interview, interview cake are great resources. Once you get comfortable maybe record yourself solving a problem so you get familiarity of what that would be like. When the interviewer is telling you something make sure you pay attention, sometimes they will drop hints to see if you pick up on things

 when they give you a question make sure you ask clarifying ones if you don't have the full picture._"friend's"_

* Basic overview of what azure is, Specially if azure is the group that is sponsoring
 Maybe how you deal with conflict in teams, how to handle situations when you don’t know a topic, how do you work in teams, why Microsoft, why programming

 Maybe take a look at glass door questions. I don’t know if there’s a Microsoft leap one but take a look and see

* For example, you can try writing your own responses and telling them to someone.I cannot say what they asked for the technical portion.You should practice building a project quickly by yourself _"friend's"_

 anything. Don't go overboard, but practicing coding can help you remember the small things that can be hard to remember (likesyntax)
Make sure to keep a document and write down your thought process as you do it.
