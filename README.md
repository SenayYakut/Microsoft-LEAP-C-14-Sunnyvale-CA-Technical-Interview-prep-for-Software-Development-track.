1. Write a program to determine if two football team can  successfully take a picture with each person face showing. i.e. no taller player standing in front of a shorter one. You must keep each team on a separate line, but you can arrange the players in a team any way you want to.(Microsoft LEAP Interview Redmond, WA)
__HINT__: The answer involves sorting and comparing. Sort the array, then check to make sure all the players on the team in front are shorter than all players in the team behind.

2. The second question was a system design question. Basically, how would you design a payroll system, then how to generate individual keys for a system, and he kept tagging more questions to the original system design question.
__Hint__:The answer included various things, reading from the database, issuing payout in parallel, authentication and authorization and every other thing I could think of. The key thing here was observing the interviewer and following his lead. i.e if he looks like he likes it then it's a good design if he doesn't just scrap it and think of something else.
